# Pokémon Battle Companion

PBC was created to provide a quick way to check a pokémon's weaknesses when battling. You can search for a pokémon in a specific generation, and it will show you what all of its weaknesses were in that generation. There is also an interactive type chart, again customisable by generation, that allows you to freeze rows and columns for easier reading.
